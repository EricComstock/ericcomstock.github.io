          <span class="firstcharacter">E</span>ric Comstock is a childrens book illustrator + author. Eric took an illustration class in college and was encouraged to pursue his talents but he also liked advertising. After 11 years as an art director he shifted gears and took up illustration. 
    		  Since then he’s worked with Land of Nod, Hallmark, Shutterfly, TeNeues, Moda Fabrics, Oopsy Daisy, Graniph and many others. He is currently working on children’s book series with Marilyn Sadler. His illustrations are bright and quirky with a mid-century modern appeal. <img src="images/ericphoto.jpg" alt="Eric" class="align-left medium">Eric lives in Austin, TX where he and his wife work together often as they raise 4 kids and one dog.
