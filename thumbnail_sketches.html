 	<li><strong>AIGA</strong><p>With this site <strong>hierarchy</strong> is established with AIGA's square logo firmly placed in the upper left-hand corner. <strong>Focal points</strong> are created by using extra bold san serif fonts for the headlines. This design choice creates contrast. <strong>Balance</strong> is created with the placement of a wide column and then a narrow column and so on. The placement of the wide column in respect to the narrow column also allows for a nice flow.</p><br><img src="designchallenge1_aiga_wf.gif" title="This is a thumbnail sketch of AIGA website home page."></li>

The serif font is bold and italicized. The headline is also set in a bigger size then any other headline on the page. <strong>Focal point</strong> takes the viewer to the main photo at the top of the page and then their eye is guide the left-hand where they can begin to scan the different columns. <strong>Balance</strong> is established by the use of different headlines.
