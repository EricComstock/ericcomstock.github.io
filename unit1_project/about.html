		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm an illustrator & designer living in Austin, TX. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development while designing my first website 10 years ago. It was a great project to work on and I learned a lot. The part I didn't like was not having an understanding of what the programmer was doing. I realized that until I did my web design would not translate the way I wanted it to. So it took me a while to get here but that's why I'm taking this class today.</p>
		
		<h3>My Goal</h3>
		<p>I love the idea of learning something new and then using that info to build something that will inform or educate or simply delight. As I learn about front-end development, my hope is to work in some capacity in the fields of UI or UX design and create something cool. I'll keep you posted when I decide what to do with my newly gained super powers :)</p>
